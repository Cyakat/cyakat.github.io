                    <h1>FormMail</h1>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        FormMail is a easy way to allow users to submit forms on your website. It also enables those forms to be sent to your email. This allows for easy surveys or
                        just allowing the user to easily get in touch with you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ease of Registration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Registration is very simple only requires an email adress and a password. Once you have signed up, it will ask you to verify your email. You will probably have to check your spam folder unfortunately.
                        After that though, all you have to do is sign in and you're ready to go!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Services Offered</h3>
                    <p>
                        FormMail only offers one service and that is allowing your website forms to send you emails. Very simple concept but very useful.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Site Banner And Advertising</h3>
                    <p>
                        The website's site banner isn't all that special and just consists of a logo and some text saying to subscribe to the service. The navbar is inexplicably small and I only just noticed that it was there.
                        This service has no advertising except for the creator asking people to use it as far as I can tell.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
                    <p>
                        The site offers a quick start guide allowing you to easily setup a form on your own website. Though the way that this is done is not particularly secure. 
                        It seems pretty easy to just go into the source code and easily obtain their mailbox number and email address.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wouldn't use this because it is too easy for someone to steal your mailbox number and spam your email with garbage. It also brings you to a very ugly webpage after submiting
