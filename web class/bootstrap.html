                    <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Bootstrap is a very useful service for making any webpage. It provides many way to make your website more dynamic and easier to create. Bootstrap helps with the layout of your
                        webpage as well as allowing the whole thing to be dynamic. The dynamic nature of bootstrap allows you to easily use the same web code for both desktop and smartphone.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ease of Registration and Services Offered</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bootstrap requires no registration and offers their service for free. They only offer a single script but is the only script your website will need for full Bootstrap capability.
                        The service that bootstrap offers is one that allows you to improve your website. Making it work for both mobile and desktop
                    </p>
                    <h3>Site banner, Advertisment, and Ease of Use</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bootstrap has a very catchy frontpage that encourages you to get started right away.
                        As for advertising, Bootstrap doesn't make any money off of people using their service as it is open source and doesn't need dedicated developers. Bootstrap, however, is prevelent because of its
                        incredible usefulness. It has been recommended to me multiple times and I also recommend it. I barely know how to use it and it still works great for even me.
                        Bootstrap also has very detailed documentation and videos avaiable online if you would prefer to learn that way.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bootstrap is an incredibly powerful tool for any web designer whether you are just starting out or you have lots of experience. Bootstrap will improve the look and use of your website. I highly recommend it!
