      <p class="normal-text">Hello! I am Tiko Bauer and I enjoy programming and making things! I know a few programming languages and I will rank them in order of proficiency: Javascript, Lua, Html, Css, C++, Java, C#</p>
      <p class="normal-text">I am working on a project right now involving full-stack web development. I am making a website that will allow people to easily host and manage a Minecraft Server. I started work on this because I have been hosting Minecraft Servers for my friends for a while now. The issue is that they would have to ask me to setup everything. This worked well enough for people who aren't very technical as they wouldn't know what to do with the access they had anyway</p>
      <p class="normal-text">However, I have a few friends that are a bit more technical and are capable of managing Minecraft Servers on their own. Though they usually used online and paid services and I wanted them to use mine for free. But it can be hard to use my service since they had little control over the server files and configuration and instead would just have to settle with being an admin on the Minecraft Server.</p>
