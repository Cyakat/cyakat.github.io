                    IoT (Internet of Things) devices can improve the efficiency of the lives 
                    of people as well as manufacturing. IoT can be used to control small things 
                    around that house like turning on lights when it becomes dark or booting up 
                    your computer in the morning. In manufacturing, these devices can monitor the 
                    conditions of a product and remove it from the production line if it does not 
                    meet the criteria. These devices can also monitor the integrity of machines 
                    predicting breakdowns increasing work safety. Read more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iot/">here.</a>

                    The Internet of Things are other devices, not phones or computers, 
                    that are connected to the internet to collect data and automate 
                    simple tasks. Almost everything can be an IoT device. The data collected 
                    doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that it is sent to large company. All of the 
                    data could be kept within your home and given to other devices so that 
                    they can perform actions based on certain conditions. For example, if 
                    it is raining outside (data collected from a moisture sensor on your 
                    roof for example), the moisture sensor could tell your sprinklers to 
                    turn off. More information about this <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/internet-of-things-definition/">here.</a>

                    The increasing amount of IoT devices poses a potential security risk. 
                    However, since this technology can be incredibly useful, governments 
                    are working on mandating basic security on all future devices ensuring 
                    consumers can have these devices installed without worry. Read more

                    A web application is software that is provided through your browser. 
                    It is what is known as Software as a Service. Web applications are 
                    becoming more popular because of their ease of use for the consumer. 
                    Web applications do not need to be installed on every machine you want 
                    to use them on and some are also available to use on your smartphone. 
                    Common web applications are sites such as one drive, google, drive, Word 
                    (on your browser), and Google docs. Read more <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-web-application">here.</a>

                <p>
                    Progressive web applications or PWAs are web applications that 
                    can be downloaded onto a machine. It still functions the same as 
                    it would on your browser but with more functionality and reduced 
                    loading time and increased convenience. PWAs benefit from being a 
                    web app and an installed app. Since the application is still web 
                    based, it allows seamless switching from the installed version to 
                    the browser version. Many companies are switching to this approach 
                    and a well known company that is already making use of this 
                    technology is Discord. They have an installable app for computers 
                    and phones but it is also available on the web so you are still 
                    able to access the application in case you are on a new device.
