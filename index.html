      <p>This is my nice website. I am Tiko Bauer and I have been doing programming for a bit. I think that I am pretty decent at it. I don't really have anyone to do it for yet so I just do all of my programming for fun.</p>
      <p>I have practice in html, javascript, C, lua, python. Most of my practice from html has been making this website and my web programming class. My javascript programming has come from making a few discord bots (they aren't very good but they are fun). My C programming has come from a programming class that I took. My lua programming experience has come from a Minecraft mod that I have put probably too much time into. It is called OpenComputers. My python experience has come from little scripts that I have made. I have the least practice in python.</p>
      <p>I have two Minecraft servers. One of them is vanilla (no mods) and the other one is modded. You can find more info about the servers in the servers dropdown in the navbar</p>
